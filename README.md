[Publication](https://doi.org/10.22214/ijraset.2022.47109)

-	Spearheaded the research, model development and deployment tasks of the project.
-	Conceptualized a customized CNN model that was trained to classify MRI images as Tumorous or Non-Tumorous with an accuracy of 96% using deep learning libraries like OpenCV, Keras and TensorFlow.
-	Successfully deployed the model on Heroku and integrated it into a user-friendly website, enabling end users to effortlessly upload their MRI scans and obtain diagnostic results through a convenient drag and drop interface.
-	Published the findings in International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology (IJRASET).
